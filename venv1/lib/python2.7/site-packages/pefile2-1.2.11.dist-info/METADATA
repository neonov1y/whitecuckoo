pefile, Portable Executable reader module

All the PE file basic structures are available with their default names
as attributes of the instance returned.

Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercase
names, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.

pefile has been tested against the limits of valid PE headers, that is, malware.
Lots of packed malware attempt to abuse the format way beyond its standard use.
To the best of my knowledge most of the abuses are handled gracefully.
